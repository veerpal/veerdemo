Hi Sir/Mam.

I'm an intuitive thinker with a strong desire to learn all the technologies in the development field, currently enhancing my 
skills with web Development using Java Technology. Having worked on java
 for the past 2.6 year, I've met a lot of creative people who
 live to code and learnt a lot of things for them.

Currently working as a Software Developer in Lex Innova technologies Ltd. and previously worked in 
Synergy Software Ltd. as a Java Developer It's been total 2.6 year now with Lex Innova technologies Ltd.

I don't just code, I write them to solve problems, and I'm waiting for the time, right and creative people to work with,
 when I'll be able to solve a real life problem using my programming skills.

I also have sound knowledge of Spring, Hibernate,JPA,Apache Solr because this technology is used in my current project.
